# Matrigel mold for the diSPIM

When placing organoids on the diSPIM (see [Kara's eLife paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/36739), we use a 10mm diameter glass coverslip with a drop of Matrigel on top.  The organoids tend to settle on the bottom of that drop.  Since the working distance of the objectives is short, the objectives tend to push on the Matrigel when getting close to the correct focus.  Sometimes this slightly pushes the objective out of alignment, leading to distortions in the sheet.  Moreover, imaging through large layers of Matrigel increases spherical aberration.

Here, I am testing a PDMS mold in which to poor the Matrigel with organoids.  By placing the coverslip on top before the Matrigel hardens, I hope that it will be possible to lift the Matrigel up, resulting in organoids in the top of the Matrigel rather than the bottom.

The pdf and svg files here are to lasercut a mold out of acrylic.  The small circles should be cut from 3mm acrylic, the frame around it from 6mm acrylic, the base can be either thickness.
